# Terraform - virtual machine

Choose any cloud provider you prefer. Use a free trial period, such as the one offered by DigitalOcean. Add a .gitignore file to your project to exclude files generated by Terraform. Configure SSH key-based authentication for accessing your virtual machine. Ensure that no password is required for login. Create a user named ansible and a group named ansible, with permissions equivalent to the root user. Output the assigned IP address of the virtual machine to the terminal for easy reference. If all tasks are successfully completed, destroy the environment to avoid unnecessary charges. Task should be done using Terraform
